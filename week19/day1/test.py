### Exercise: Advanced Data Manipulation and Analysis
In this exercise, you will analyze data from a hypothetical online retail company to gain insights into sales trends and customer behavior. The data is represented as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about a single purchase.

sales_data = [
    {"customer_id": 1, "product": "Smartphone", "price": 600, "quantity": 1, "date": "2023-04-03"},
    {"customer_id": 2, "product": "Laptop", "price": 1200, "quantity": 1, "date": "2023-04-04"},
    {"customer_id": 1, "product": "Laptop", "price": 1000, "quantity": 1, "date": "2023-04-05"},
    {"customer_id": 2, "product": "Smartphone", "price": 500, "quantity": 2, "date": "2023-04-06"},
    {"customer_id": 3, "product": "Headphones", "price": 150, "quantity": 4, "date": "2023-04-07"},
    {"customer_id": 3, "product": "Smartphone", "price": 550, "quantity": 1, "date": "2023-04-08"},
    {"customer_id": 1, "product": "Headphones", "price": 100, "quantity": 2, "date": "2023-04-09"},
]
*Tasks:*
1. *Total Sales Calculation*: Calculate the total sales for each product category (i.e., the total revenue generated from each type of product). Use a loop to iterate through the data and a dictionary to store the total sales for each product.
2. *Customer Spending Profile*: Determine the total amount spent by each customer. Use a dictionary to maintain the sum of amounts each customer has spent.
3. *Sales Data Enhancement*:
    - Add a new field to each transaction called "total_price" that represents the total price for that transaction (quantity * price).
    - Use a loop to modify the sales_data list with this new information.
4. *High-Value Transactions*:
    - Using list comprehension, create a list of all transactions where the total price is greater than $500.
    - Sort this list by the total price in descending order.
5. *Customer Loyalty Identification*:
    - Identify any customer who has made more than one purchase, suggesting potential loyalty.
    - Use a dictionary to count purchases per customer, then use a loop or comprehension to identify customers meeting the loyalty criterion.
6. *Bonus: Insights and Analysis*:
    - Calculate the average transaction value for each product category.
    - Identify the most popular product based on the quantity sold.
    - Provide insights into how these analyses could inform the companyâ€™s marketing strategies.
