// Instructions
// In this exercise we will be creating a webpage with a black background as the universe and we will fill the universe with planets and their moons.
// We will provide the HTML page.
// You only have to work with a JS file.

//1. Create an array which value is the planets of the solar system.
//2. For each planet in the array, create a <div> using createElement. This div should have a class named "planet".
//3. Each planet should have a different background color. (Hint: you could add a new class to each planet - each class containing a different background-color).
//4. Finally append each div to the <section> in the HTML (presented below).
//5. Bonus: Do the same process to create the moons.
//- Be careful, each planet has a certain amount of moons. How should you display them?
//- Should you still use an array for the planets ? Or an array of objects ?

const planets = [
{name: "Mercury" ,moons: 0}, 
{name: "Venus" ,moons: 0}, 
{name: "Earth" ,moons: 1}, 
{name: "Mars" ,moons: 2}, 
{name: "Jupiter" ,moons: 95}, 
{name: "Saturn" ,moons: 146}, 
{name: "Uranus" ,moons:27}, 
{name: "Neptune" ,moons: 14}]

for(const planet of planets){
    const div = document.createElement("div")
    div.classList.add("planet")
    div.classList.add(planet.name.toLowerCase())
    
    for (let i =0; i < planet.moons; i++){
        const moonDiv = document.createElement("div")
        moonDiv.classList.add("moon")
        moonDiv.style.left = i * 5 + "px"
        div.appendChild(moonDiv)
    }


    const section = document.querySelector(".listPlanets")
    section?.appendChild(div)
