// Convert this JS object into a JSON object. What happens to the nested objects ?

// Resp: Because we converted it in to a JSON object now all is stringified wich means that even the nested objects are in string form.

// Convert and pretty print this JS object into a JSON object. Hint : Check out the JSON lesson on the platform.

// Use your web inspector to add a breakpoint. Check the values of the JSON object in the debugger.

const stringified = JSON.stringify(marioGame, null, 5)
console.log(stringified);
